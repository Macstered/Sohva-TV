# Sohva TV 0.1.0-beta.6

Prepared: **6 September 2026**. Android version code: **7**.

Sixth Sohva TV tester package. On beta 3 or later, fetch it from **Settings >
About > Check for updates**; on earlier betas, install it over the existing
app without uninstalling or clearing data. This is a non-commercial beta, not
a public-launch announcement.

## Changed since beta 5

- Programme guide, catch-up and Sohva Sport times are shown in the TV's own
  time zone unless one is chosen. They used to default to Finnish time, so a
  tester elsewhere read every programme hours off. The setting is now
  labelled **Time zone** under Sohva Sport, with a "TV's own" option.

## Included

- Sohva TV name, couch/play logo, TV launcher banner and accessible wordmarks.
- Sohva Sport name and orange companion branding.
- Live TV, programme guide, movies, series, playback resume and optional
  TMDB / TVmaze / API-Sports integrations using the tester's own credentials.
- Library organisation, custom channel lists, remote button mapping, phone
  setup, interface size and in-app update check.
- English and Finnish app interface; English installation and testing guide.

## Update compatibility

Future Sohva TV betas should be installed over this one without uninstalling or
clearing data, or fetched from **Settings > About**. This beta uses Android
build 7; every later distributed build must use a higher build number. A zone
chosen earlier is kept; a TV that never chose one now follows its own zone.
Backups record which of the two applies; older backups restore the zone they
carry.

## Testing context

The beta passed its build gate and the unit-test suite, and a full emulator run
of the database and UI tests on the released source. These are bounded
results, not a guarantee for every device or source.

See [known limitations and the feedback checklist](TESTING.md). A missing
poster can still require selecting the correct TMDB match again. Provider
availability, quotas and stream compatibility remain outside the app's control.

## Source publication

The source for this beta is published under `GPL-3.0-only` in this repository,
and the release tag points at the commit it was built from. It produces the
same signed APK when built with the private release identity; the signing key
and credentials are not part of the source.
